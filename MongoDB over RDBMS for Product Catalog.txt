Advantage of using MongoDB for Product Catalog over RDBMS : 
============================================================

- Product Catalog contains various items of different category & sub categories.
- Products in Product Catalog contain differents of attributes.
- MongoDB is an appropraite solution for this system.
- MongoDB have a ability to handle these types of requirement. Bcoz MongoDB is stores documents in form of JSON and it is not necessary to have all attirubures to store in same collection.
- Using MongoDB : 
	- any entity can have any numnber of attributes.
	- easily scalable, any number of products can be added with any number of attributes without changing any DB Model.
	- faster reads, no JOINS required





Drawback & Approach using RDBMS:
==================================
- create new table for every category : this approach will not only increase number of tables ( space ) but also will decrease the query performance while fetching data due to JOINS.
- create single table with all attributes : this approach will allow all products to stored in one table but will consume space for non relevant attributes.
- if any product attributes changes / added : data model needs to be updated
